Each of these defines a `fit` method, which develops a model from provided training data, and a `predict` method, which uses the model to map a new instance to a suitable target value. Scikit-learn also defines multiple utilities for partitioning and manipulating data sets as well as evaluating models.\n","\n","Below, we cover some of the basic steps needed to create a model in scikit-learn.
